# Recognition of Handwritten Digits

## Introduction
MNIST is a standard machine learning dataset used for handwritten digit recognition.
Used for training and evaluating machine learning models.

---

## Description
60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing.
Grayscale pixel matrix (28x28 pixels).
The numbers from 0 to 9 correspond to each image.

## Utilization
- Graphical interface that allows the user to draw a figure and then have the algorithm classify that figure
- Effective implementation of the Gradient Descent algorithm
- Performance comparison between the raw data set and the same data set, only processed with PCA
